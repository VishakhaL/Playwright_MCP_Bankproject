Prompt1 - Playwright Project setup
Create a Playwright TypeScript test project using "npm init playwright@latest" command in the current folder

Can you please make sure that tests are running successfully?

Prompt2 - End-to-end test creation for banking application
Generate a playwright typescript test for the following scenarios:
- You are a playwright test generator.
- You are given a scenario and you need to generate a playwright test for it.
- DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone.
- Use Playwright MCP to open the browser and interact with the site
- Discover selectors and flows by live exploration, not by static code generation
- Navigate to https://bakkappan.github.io/Testers-Talk-Practice-Site/
- Enter username & password as TestersTalk
- Select App Name as Banking and Login into the application
- After login, verify:
     - URL contains "Banking-Project-Demo.html"
     - The page header shows "🏦 Sample Banking Application"
     - Verify text as "Welcome to the Testers Talk Banking Application"
- Click on Quick Transactions link
- Select Transaction Type as Transfer
- Enter all other mandatory fields then click on Submit button
- Click on Confirm button
- Note down Transaction Reference: number
- Verify Transaction Reference: number in the Transaction History
- Save generated test file as banking-test.spec.ts & test name as "Verify Quick Transactions Flow" in the tests directory
- Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes
- Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behaviour
- Structure tests properly with descriptive test titles and comments

Technical details:
- Use role-based selectors wherever possible(getByRole)
- Add appropriate waiting for navigation after login
- Add appropriate timeouts for assertions

Prompt3 - Page Object Model refactoring
- Let's convert test into page object model design pattern
- Create a pages folder under root directory & add pages under this folder only
- Create 4 pages - LoginPage, HomePage, QuickTransactionPage & TransactionHistoryPage then add abstractions methods in the respective pages
- Create one BasePage which contains common actions for all the pages
- Finally update the test with respect page object methods

Prompt4 - Configuration management
- Create a config.json file under root directory
- Add URL, username, password & app name key-value pairs in the config.json file
- Finally access all the property values in the test wherever it is required

Prompt5 - Test data management
- Create a test-data folder under root directory
- Create a Transfer_TestData.json file under test-data folder
- Keep all the transfer details in the Transfer_TestData.json in the key-values pairs
- Finally access Transfer_TestData.json test data in test file

Prompt6 - Advanced test generation using Playwright MCP Server without using application url, username/password etc.
Write a Playwright typescript test using playwright mcp.
1. You are a playwright test generator.
2. DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone.
3. Use Playwright MCP to open the browser and interact with the site
4. Discover selectors and flows by live exploration, not by static code generation
5. Add a new test as verify tab names in the homepage in the banking-test.spec.ts file
6. Instantiate the LoginPage and HomePage page objects.
7. Navigate to the login page using the URL from the config.
8. Log in using credentials from the config.
9. Verify that the home page loads successfully.
10. Check that the Transfers & Bill Payment tabs are visible
11. Save newly generated test under banking-test.spec.ts file
12. Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes
13. Make sure to use Playwright's best practices and page object model.
